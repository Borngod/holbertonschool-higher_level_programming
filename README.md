## Requirements

* The Python scripts were built with the **3.4.3 version**.
* The C scripts were built with the **C89 standard**.
* The C scripts were compiled with **GNU Compiler Collection 4.8.4**.

## Projects
* **0x00. Python - Hello, World** - This is the first project made with Python and consists of knowing some of its bases. The aim of the project is to know about the **Zen of Python**, the **Python interpreter**, print text and variables with `print`, how to use **strings**, understand **indexing** and **slicing** in Python and apply the [pycodestyle](https://pypi.org/project/pycodestyle/) guide.
* **0x01. Python - if/else, loops, functions** - The objective of this project is to learn the importance of **identation** in Python, how to use `if` and `if ... else` statements, use **comments**, affect variable values, use `while` and `for` cycles, use `break` and `continue` statements, use `else` clauses in a loop, use `range`, use **functions**, scope of variables, traceback and arithmetic operators.

## Usage
The tests of programs written in C are recommended to compile as follows:

```bash
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic filename.c -o output_program 
```
