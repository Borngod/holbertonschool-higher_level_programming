# Hello World, Python!
This is the first project made with Python and consists of knowing some of its bases.

## Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, I learned how to explain to anyone, without the help of **Google**:

* Why Python programming is awesome?
* Who created Python?
* Who is Guido van Rossum?
* Where does the name Python come from?
* What is the Zen of Python?
* How to use the Python interpreter?
* How to print text and variables using print?
* How to use strings?
* What are indexing and slicing in Python?
* How to apply the syntax code of [pycodestyle](https://pypi.org/project/pycodestyle/)?

## Tasks

### Run Python file
This task proposes to create a shell script that runs a Python script, in which its name is stored in the environment variable `$PYFILE`.

### Run inline
This task proposes to create a shell script that runs in a single-line a Python code, in which its code is stored in the environment variable `$PYCODE`.

### Hello, print
This task proposes to create a Python script that prints exactly `"Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle`, followed by a new line.

### Print integer
This task proposes to complete a [source code](https://github.com/holbertonschool/0x00.py/blob/master/3-print_number.py) to print the integer stored in the variable `number`, followed by `Battery street`, followed by a new line.

**Requirements:**
* No cast the variable `number` to string.
* Exactly 3 lines long.

### Print float
This task proposes to complete a [source code](https://github.com/holbertonschool/0x00.py/blob/master/4-print_float.py) to print the string `Float:`, followed by the float stored in the variable `number` with a precision of 2 digits, followed by a new line.

**Requirements:**
* No cast the variable `number` to string.

### Print string
This task proposes to complete a [source code](https://github.com/holbertonschool/0x00.py/blob/master/5-print_string.py) to 
print 3 times a string stored in the variable `str` with a new line, followed by its first 9 characters and a new line.

**Requirements:**
* No loops or conditional statements.
* Maximum 5 lines long.

### Play with strings
This task proposes to complete a [source code](https://github.com/holbertonschool/0x00.py/blob/master/6-concat.py) to print `Welcome to Holberton School!`.

**Requirements:**
* No loops or conditional statements.
* Use the variables `str1` and `str2` in the new line of code.
* Exactly 5 lines long.

### Copy, Cut and Paste
This task proposes to complete a [source code](https://github.com/holbertonschool/0x00.py/blob/master/7-edges.py) to print:
* `word_first_3` should contain the first 3 letters of the variable `word`.
* `word_last_2` should contain the last 2 letters of the variable `word`.
* `middle_word` should contain the value of the variable `word` without the first and last letters.

**Requirements:**
* No loops or conditional statements.
* Exactly 8 lines long.

### Create a new sentence
This task proposes to complete a [source code](https://github.com/holbertonschool/0x00.py/blob/master/8-concat_edges.py) to print `object-oriented programming with Python`, followed by a new line.

**Requirements:**
* No loops or conditional statements.
* No new variables used.
* No string literals.
* Exactly 5 lines long.

### Easter Egg
This task proposes to print _The Zen of Python_, by _Tim Peters_, followed by a new line.

### Linked list cycle (C programming language)
This task proposes to write a function that checks if a singly linked list has a cycle in it.
* Return: `0` if there is no cycle, `1` if there is a cycle.

**Requirements:**
* Only these functions are allowed: `write`, `printf`, `putchar`, `puts`, `malloc`, `free`.

### Hello, write
This task proposes to create a Python script that prints exactly `and that piece of art is useful - Dora Korpar, 2015-10-19`, followed by a new line.

**Requirements:**
* No use `print`.
* Use the function `write` from the `sys` module.
* Print to `stderr`.
* Exit with the status code `1`.

### Compile
This task proposes to write a script that compiles a Python script file, in which its name is stored in the environment variable `$PYFILE`. The output filename has to be `$PYFILEc`.

### Bytecode -> Python
Write a function that does the same as a given Python Bytecode.
